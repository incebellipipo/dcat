## Easy Dockerization of Catkin packages : DCat

##### Quick Disclaimer: This project currently under development, any help will be appreciated.

# Motivation
Every year Ubuntu and ROS releases new distro, and it really hard to catch up. It becomes
really hard to re-run old codes that developed elder versions of those distros. Soo what i
want to do is simplify these distro changes, re-run my old code without changing my lovely
running system configuration.
